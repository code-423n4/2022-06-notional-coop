hey for the scope, do we have all the contracts or just the 2 ones and the interactions with the rest?


[06/07/2022 9:47 PM] jeffwu_notional
as far as the wrapped fCash contracts the scope is what is in there right now


[06/07/2022 9:48 PM] jeffwu_notional
the `batchLend` method is not yet deployed but can be seen here: https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/pull/99/files#diff-7a142e7e5b1d3b1189701a019061fe0eb4b24187fbf1380d9a8b19977a13a3ae, i decided not to pull it into scope due to all the dependencies in that file already

[06/07/2022 9:50 PM] jeffwu_notional
we have pretty high test coverage on that method and it follows the existing pattern for the rest of the methods in that file which have been audited, however, if there are issues with it i will obviously accept any bug reports


[06/07/2022 9:51 PM] jeffwu_notional
perhaps any discussion related to code out of scope should happen outside of this contest though


[06/07/2022 9:51 PM] jeffwu_notional
as far as the index coop scope, i would defer to @christn | IndexCoop


[06/07/2022 10:44 PM] 0xkitsune
Just checking that gas optimizations have the same  scope as security? Let me know if this looks right!
```
NationalTradeModule
wfCashBase
wfCashERC4626
wfCashLogic
WrappedCashFactory
```


[06/07/2022 11:03 PM] jeffwu_notional
I believe that is the case, @Jay | C4 might be able to clarify

[06/07/2022 11:48 PM] .christn
For the IndexCoop part only the `NotionalTradeModule` and it's interactions with the rest of the set architecture are in scope.


[06/07/2022 11:51 PM] .christn
Hey Everyone,
I'm Christian, a core contributor at IndexCoop and the author of the `NotionalTradeModule`.
If you have any questions regarding the IndexCoop part of the contest feel free to ask me. DM's are open.

Yep that is correct. Gas optimizations have the same scope as security.

Hi @Jeff Wu | Notional  
I'm not familiar with Brownie and I'm running into some problems.
When trying to run tests with the command `brownie test`, I get the following error:
`ImportError: cannot import name 'WrappedFcashProject' from 'brownie.project'`
Except `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt` is there any other command to run to init the project?


[06/08/2022 5:23 AM] 100proof
On Ubuntu 22.04 I had to apply the following diff do make things compile using `brownie`.
```
diff --git a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol b/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol

However the error I had was different to what you had @Pierrick


[06/08/2022 5:24 AM] 100proof
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` just did not work with `eth-brownie==1.18.1`. I had to bump the version to get it to work.


[06/08/2022 5:28 AM] 100proof
Hmm, I'm still having problems. When I run `brownie test` I get 
```

Any ideas?


[06/08/2022 11:49 AM] jeffwu_notional
i believe brownie gets the project name from the folder of the repo in some way


[06/08/2022 11:53 AM] jeffwu_notional
try changing that name to NotionalWrappedFcashProject since you are using the code arena repo

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[06/08/2022 11:54 AM] jeffwu_notional
also i did update the tests a bit so they can run on a mainnet fork with a canary deployment of some changes, i dont belive they are in the contest repo but you can see them here: https://github.com/notional-finance/wrapped-fcash/blob/master/tests/test_wrapped_fcash.py#L20-L32

Checked the test coverage, there seems to be 100% coverage for some files, 0 for another. Wondering why is this?

I’m not sure myself, have to check later


[06/10/2022 3:02 AM] abhinavmir#1898
@Jeff Wu | Notional another question - wfcash repo has both brownie yaml and hardhat config - why the latter since the deploys happen from brownie? fair warning, i haven't used brownie much


[06/10/2022 11:14 AM] jeffwu_notional
hardhat is used for fork testing


[06/10/2022 7:37 PM] abhinavmir#1898
gotcha - which one do we usually use to deploy?


[06/10/2022 9:53 PM] rotcivegaf
Are the contracts inherited by the `NotionalTradeModule` contract in scope? 
Like `ModuleBase`


[06/10/2022 10:51 PM] .christn
Generally the scope of the contest is limited to the `NotionalTradeModule`. I'd say that the dependencies are only in scope as far as their interaction / usage by the `NotionalTradeModule` is concerned. 
I.e. if you find an issue in the `NotionalTradeModule` that stems from it's interaction with any of these dependencies then that'd be in scope whereas an issue in these dependencies that does not affect the `NotionalTradeModule` would not be. (if you do find such an issue you might want to take a look at set protocols bug bounty program though: https://docs.tokensets.com/protocol/security#bug-bounty).

Also those dependencies are not in scope for the gas-optimization. Most of these dependencies have been audited by OZ in their set protocol audit: https://blog.openzeppelin.com/set-protocol-audit/#:~:text=Set%20Protocol%20provides%20a%20mechanism,goal%20but%20changes%20the%20architecture.

hi, just need some bit of clarification please.... when you call `NotionalV2.batchBalanceAndTradeAction()` , does it update `token.balanceOf(address(this))` assume not ETH? So far I understand calling it means you're selling fCash via borrowing


[06/12/2022 6:49 AM] .christn
Cc @Jeff Wu | Notional


[06/13/2022 1:47 AM] jonah1005
That's kind of the entrypoint of the notional protocol. Users can do many different things through `NotionalV2.batchBalanceAndTradeAction()`  Provideing/removing liquidity(ntoken), depositing, withdrawing, lending/ borrowing/ [BatchAction.sol#L71-L78](https://github.com/notional-finance/contracts-v2/blob/master/contracts/external/actions/BatchAction.sol#L71-L78) 
I think the protocol would pull tokens from user if there's depositing actions.
